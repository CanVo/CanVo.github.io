# WIP Blog

Wanted some place to jot down my notes and publish for easy management rather than having to store it all locally or in a physical journal.

## Blog can be reached at:
https://canvo.github.io/blog

## Useful commands/stuff for me:

View locally
`npm run start`

Published Changes
`npm run deploy`

Comment in jsx files:
`{/* comment */}`

Live content will be published on to the `gh-pages` branch.

## TO-DO
- Add and populate a proper Credits section to give credit for the royalty free assets I used.
- Re-organize/refactor some directories so they are pulled correctly (IE: Article Cards, Misc Cards, etc.)
- Determine how to properly denote file paths when trying to link an image, should it still be in a variable? Should images and vids be in the public dir? etc.
- Add & tie domain to blog.
- Update test pictures / place holder cards.
- Look into the trailing slash with the gh-page url.
- Plan / structure how the CTF section will be laid out. Things to consider: Categories, CTF name, CTF Problem, Images and files. Can get fancy with this.
- Plan the credits section. Should it be in the layout of cards? Should it just be one big page? etc.
- Clean up unneeded files from react app initialization.
- Figure out how to lay out the url directory names of articles. Several approaches such as first couple words with hyphen, hashing it then getting x amount of chars, etc.
