# WIP Blog

Wanted some place to jot down my notes and publish for easy management rather than having to store it all locally or in a physical journal.

## Blog can be reached at:
https://canvo.github.io/ (Will soon tie this to a proper domain).

## Useful commands/stuff for me:

View locally
`npm run start`

Publish Changes
`npm run deploy`

Comment in jsx files:
`{/* comment */}`

Live content will be published on to the `gh-pages` branch.

## TO-DO
- Add and populate a proper Credits section to give credit for the royalty free assets I used.
- Add & tie domain to blog.
- Plan / structure how the CTF section will be laid out. Things to consider: Categories, CTF name, CTF Problem, Images and files. Can get fancy with this.
- Plan the credits section. Should it be in the layout of cards? Should it just be one big page? etc.
- Look into seeing if I can fade a whole page upon clicking on it.
