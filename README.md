# WIP Blog

Wanted some place to jot down my notes and publish for easy management rather than having it all locally or in a journal.

## Blog can be reached at:
canvo.github.io/blog

## Useful commands for me:

View locally
`npm run start`

Published Changes
`npm run deploy`

Live content will be published to `gh-pages` branch.
